## Risk Mitigation

### Pilot Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Pilot Sign-Ups**
- **Probability**: Low (20%) - Farsight committed to 3 customers
- **Impact**: Medium (delays validation)
- **Mitigation**: Expand outreach beyond Farsight, offer higher discounts (75% off)

**Risk 2: Product Performance Issues**
- **Probability**: Medium (30%) - New production environment
- **Impact**: High (customer churn, bad reviews)
- **Mitigation**: Dedicated engineering support during pilot, daily monitoring, <4hr bug fix SLA

**Risk 3: Low Conversion Rate (<50%)**
- **Probability**: Low (15%) - Strong value prop
- **Impact**: High (revenue miss, poor product-market fit signal)
- **Mitigation**: Weekly value reinforcement (share time/cost savings), flexible pricing, extend pilot if needed

**Risk 4: Negative Feedback**
- **Probability**: Medium (25%) - Early product stage
- **Impact**: Medium (reputation risk)
- **Mitigation**: Treat as learning opportunity, rapid iteration, transparency with customers
