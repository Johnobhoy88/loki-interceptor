[ALTERNATIVE_1 - e.g., Using consent instead]\n   - Why not suitable: [REASON - e.g., Consent not appropriate for fraud prevention as individuals would not understand context]\n\n2. [ALTERNATIVE_2 - e.g., Anonymization]\n   - Why not suitable: [REASON - e.g., Cannot prevent fraud effectively with anonymized data]\n\n3.

Safeguards minimize risk. Overall, our legitimate interest is not overridden.]"},
