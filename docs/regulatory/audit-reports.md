- **Module:** FCA UK
- **Gate:** Fair, Clear, Not Misleading (COBS 4.2.1)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Location:** Line 3, Paragraph 1
- **Text Matched:** "Guaranteed 15% annual returns"
- **Regulation:** FCA COBS 4.2.1(1)R - Financial promotions must be fair, clear, and not misleading. Guarantees of investment returns are prohibited.
- **Reason:** Investment returns cannot be guaranteed due to market volatility. This statement violates FCA rules and Consumer Duty principle of acting in good faith.
- **Recommended Action:** Replace with: "Targeted 15% annual returns" and add risk warning.

**Violation #2: Missing Risk Warning**
- **Module:** FCA UK
- **Gate:** Risk Warnings (COBS 4.2.1)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Location:** Document-wide (missing mandatory section)
- **Regulation:** FCA COBS 4.2.1(3)R - Financial promotions must include clear and prominent risk warnings.
- **Reason:** Document promotes investment fund but lacks mandatory risk disclosure.
- **Recommended Action:** Add risk warning paragraph: "RISK WARNING: Capital at risk. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You may not get back the amount invested."

**Violation #3: Pressure Tactics**
- **Module:** FCA UK
- **Gate:** Pressure Tactics (Consumer Duty)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Location:** Line 12, Paragraph 3
- **Text Matched:** "Limited time offer - invest before midnight tonight!"
- **Regulation:** FCA Consumer Duty 2023 - Must not exploit behavioral biases or create undue pressure.
- **Reason:** Urgency language creates artificial pressure, potentially leading to unsuitable investment decisions.
- **Recommended Action:** Remove urgency language. Replace with: "Contact us to discuss whether this investment is suitable for your circumstances."
