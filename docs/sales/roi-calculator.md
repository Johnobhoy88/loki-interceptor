### Step 3: Calculate Time Savings

**Before LOKI:**

| Activity | Time per Doc | Docs/Year | Total Hours |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Draft document | 2 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Compliance review | 3 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Legal review | 1.5 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Revisions (2 rounds avg) | 2 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| **TOTAL TIME** | **8.5 hours** | | **[TOTAL] hours** |

**After LOKI:**

| Activity | Time per Doc | Docs/Year | Total Hours |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Draft document | 2 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| LOKI validation | 0.05 hours (3 min) | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Apply corrections | 0.25 hours (15 min) | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Final compliance review | 0.5 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| Legal review (if needed) | 0.5 hours | [Your #] | [Calc] hours |
| **TOTAL TIME** | **3.3 hours** | | **[TOTAL] hours** |

**Time Savings:** 5.2 hours per document (61% reduction)
**Annual Hours Saved:** [Calc based on your docs/year]
**Value of Time Saved:** [Hours] × £[Avg hourly rate] = **£[TOTAL]**

**Risk Reduction Value:**

| Risk | Current Expected Cost | LOKI Risk Reduction | New Expected Cost | Savings |

| Employment tribunal | £1,200 | 90% | £120 | £1,080 |
| Reputational damage | £1,000 | 80% | £200 | £800 |
| **TOTAL RISK SAVINGS** | | | | **£20,167** |

### Step 5: Calculate ROI

**ROI Formula:**
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%
```

**Total Annual Benefits:**
- Labor cost savings: £[From Step 3]
- Risk reduction value: £[From Step 4]
- Indirect benefits: £[Faster time-to-market, etc.]
- **TOTAL BENEFITS:** £[SUM]

**Total Annual Costs:**
- LOKI subscription: £5,988
- Implementation (Year 1 only): £[From Step 2]
- **TOTAL COSTS:** £[SUM]

**ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = (£[Benefits] - £[Costs]) / £[Costs] × 100%
ROI = [Percentage]%
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = Total Costs / (Monthly Benefits)
Payback = [Months]
```

## Example ROI Calculations

### Example 1: Small Financial Services Firm

**Profile:**
- 15 employees
- 60 documents/year (marketing materials, client letters)
- 1 part-time compliance officer (£30K/year)
- Occasional external lawyer (£450/hour)

**Current Costs:**
- Compliance officer: £12,000 (40% time on doc review)
- External lawyer: £13,500 (30 hours/year)
- Total: £25,500/year

**LOKI Costs:**
- Professional Plan: £5,988/year

**Time Savings:**
- 5.2 hours/doc × 60 docs = 312 hours
- Value: 312 × £50/hour = £15,600

**Risk Reduction:**
- FCA risk reduction: £13,000

**ROI:**
- Benefits: £15,600 + £13,000 = £28,600
- Costs: £5,988
- ROI: (£28,600 - £5,988) / £5,988 = **378%**
- Payback: £5,988 / (£28,600/12) = **2.5 months**

---

### Example 2: Mid-Size HR Consultancy

**Profile:**
- 80 employees
- 500 documents/year (contracts, disciplinary letters, policies)
- Compliance team: 2 FTE (£50K each)
- Legal consultant retainer: £36,000/year

**Current Costs:**
- Compliance team: £50,000 (50% time on doc review)
- Legal consultant: £36,000
- Total: £86,000/year

**LOKI Costs:**
- Professional Plan: £5,988/year

**Time Savings:**
- 5.2 hours/doc × 500 docs = 2,600 hours
- Value: 2,600 × £40/hour = £104,000

**Risk Reduction:**
- Employment tribunal risk: £10,800 (based on historic 3 claims/year)

**ROI:**
- Benefits: £104,000 (time) + £10,800 (risk) = £114,800
- Costs: £5,988
- ROI: (£114,800 - £5,988) / £5,988 = **1,817%**
- Payback: £5,988 / (£114,800/12) = **0.6 months** (3 weeks!)

### Example 3: Enterprise Financial Services

**Profile:**
- 300 employees
- 2,000 documents/year
- Compliance department: 6 FTE (£60K each)

- External: £120,000
- Total: £420,000/year

**LOKI Costs:**
- Enterprise Plan: £24,000/year

**Time Savings:**
- 5.2 hours/doc × 2,000 docs = 10,400 hours
- Value: 10,400 × £60/hour = £624,000

**Risk Reduction:**
- FCA/ICO risk: £85,000 (large enterprise risk profile)

**Additional Benefits:**
- Faster time-to-market: £200,000 (15 campaigns launched 2 weeks earlier)

**ROI:**
- Benefits: £624,000 + £85,000 + £200,000 = £909,000
- Costs: £24,000
- ROI: (£909,000 - £24,000) / £24,000 = **3,688%**
- Payback: £24,000 / (£909,000/12) = **0.3 months** (2 weeks!)
