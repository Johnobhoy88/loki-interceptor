## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### UK Businesses Face a Compliance Crisis

**73% of UK SMEs** have faced regulatory penalties in the past 3 years
- **Average FCA fine:** £280,000
- **Average GDPR penalty:** £175,000
- **Employment tribunal costs:** £6,000-£12,000

**Manual compliance review is:**
- **Slow:** 2-4 hours per document
- **Expensive:** £100-500 per document
- **Inconsistent:** 75-90% accuracy (human variability)
- **Unscalable:** Cannot keep pace with business growth

**Consequences:**
- Delayed product launches (waiting for legal review)
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Brand reputation damage
- Executive stress and liability

> "We spent £50,000 on legal fees last year just reviewing marketing materials. Most were minor issues that could have been caught automatically."
> — CFO, UK FinTech (£20M revenue)
